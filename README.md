Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

Introduction and Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

About the Company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
This project folows the six steps of the data analysis projects- : ask, prepare, process, analyze,share, and act.
The director of marketing has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

Business Objective

to identify how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently and to recommend a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders
into annual members.

Data Sources

There's a total of 12 datasets used for this analysis starting from July 2020 to June 2021 which is available [LINK](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
under the [LICENSE](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company).
Each dataset captures the details of every ride logged by the customers of Cyclistic 
and data has been publicly made available which has been scrubbed to omit rider's personal information.

Documentation, Cleaning/Preparation and Data Analysis

Due to the size of all 12 datasets combined is over 750Mb and it contains more than 4 million rows.I used BigQuery for storing, data cleaning
and descriptive data analysis. I also used MS-Excel to combine the results obtained from Bigquery to perform better descriptive analysis and 
finally used Tableau to create visualizations and dashboards.

Data Visualization

Created visualizations to share my findings from the dinsights gained in order to effectively communicate with the stakeholders. Here's a the a [LINK](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A-incKmSsrDybqube0x0ELWs-y5-pOXYzCQGhC25TV8/edit#slide=id.ge471a7f6e6_0_1472)  to the visualization.
